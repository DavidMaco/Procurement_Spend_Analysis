## How to Present This Project

### In Your Resume:
```
PROCUREMENT ANALYTICS & OPTIMIZATION PROJECT
• Analyzed ₦310.4 billion procurement spend across 2,500+ transactions
• Identified ₦185.9 billion (59.9%) in cost reduction opportunities
• Built SQL database, Python analytics pipeline, and Power BI dashboard
• Tools: Python (Pandas), SQL (SQLite), Power BI, Excel
• Domain: FMCG Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Procurement
```

### In Interviews:
**"Walk me through this project"**

"This project addresses a critical problem in FMCG manufacturing: procurement inefficiency. 

I analyzed 2 years of procurement data covering ₦310 billion in spend and found three major opportunities:

1. **Supplier Performance Issues** (₦167B): We had suppliers with 40% on-time delivery and 13 quality incidents. By replacing just the top 5 poor performers, we could save ₦167 billion annually.

2. **Price Standardization** (₦18.5B): I found we were paying up to 24% more for identical materials from different suppliers. Negotiating to best-available prices saves ₦18.5 billion.

3. **Maverick Buying** (₦40.6B): 13% of procurement was from non-approved or high-risk suppliers, introducing quality and compliance risks.

I used SQL for complex queries, Python for automated analysis, and Power BI for executive dashboards. The total savings potential is 59.9% of procurement costs - that's the kind of impact that gets CFO attention."

## Common Interview Questions & Your Answers

**Q: How did you identify the ₦185 billion savings?**
A: "I used three analytical approaches:
1. Price variance analysis - comparing unit prices across suppliers
2. Quality cost analysis - calculating impact of defects and late deliveries
3. Benchmarking - comparing supplier performance metrics
The numbers are conservative estimates based on replacing underperformers with median performers."

**Q: Is this data real?**
A: "The data is synthetically generated but based on realistic FMCG procurement patterns from my 5 years in the industry. The insights and methodology are directly applicable to real companies."

**Q: What would you do differently?**
A: "In a production environment, I'd add:
- Predictive analytics for supplier risk
- Automated alerting for maverick buying
- Integration with ERP systems
- Machine learning for demand forecasting
- Contract optimization algorithms"
